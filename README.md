cd 
```

The virtualenv package is required to create virtual environments. You can install it with pip:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

To create a virtual environment, you must specify a path. For example to create one in the local directory called ‘venv’, type the following:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

You can activate the python environment by running the following command:

```bash
# ubuntu
source venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
# windows
.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
```

After all required Installations and venv completed and activated, we need to execute this comment in terminal

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
